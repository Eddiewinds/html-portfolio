    <h2>My Top 3 Movies of All Time</h2>

    <hr />

    <h3>Mission Impossible</h3>
    <p>
      Mission Impossible is a series of American action spy films, based on the
      1966 TV series created by Bruce Geller. The series is mainly produced by
      Tom Cruise, who plays Ethan Hunt, an agent of the Impossible Missions
      Force (IMF). The films have been directed, written, and scored by various
      filmmakers and crew, while incorporating musical themes from the original
      series by Lalo Schifrin.
    </p>

    <p>
      Starting in 1996, the films (taking place starting six years after the
      events of the previous TV sequel series) follow the missions of the IMF's
      main field team, under Hunt's leadership, to stop an enemy force and
      prevent an impending global disaster. The series focuses on Hunt's
      character, and like the television series' structure, is complemented by
      an ensemble cast, such as Luther Stickell (played by Ving Rhames) and
      Benji Dunn (played by Simon Pegg), who have recurring roles.
    </p>

    <p>
      The series has experienced a generally positive reception from critics. It
      is the 17th-highest-grossing film series of all time, earning over $4.09
      billion worldwide,[1] and is often cited as one of the best action
      franchises to date. The sixth film, titled Fallout, was released on July
      27, 2018 and is currently the series' highest-grossing entry. The seventh
      and eighth films are feature-length two-parters, with Mission: Impossible
      – Dead Reckoning Part One released in July 2023 and an untitled eighth
      film scheduled for release in May 2025. The films are co-produced and
      released by Paramount Pictures.
    </p>

    <p>
      2024, the series received its first Academy Award nominations, with Dead
      Reckoning Part One being nominated in the categories of Best Visual
      Effects and Best Sound at the 96th ceremony. [2]

    <h3>13 Hours: The Secret Soldiers of Benghazi</h3>
    <p>
      13 Hours: The Secret Soldiers of Benghazi is a 2016 American biographical
      action-thriller film, directed and produced by Michael Bay. Written by
      Chuck Hogan, it is based on Mitchell Zuckoff's 2014 book. The film follows
      six members of the Annex Security Team who fought to defend the American
      diplomatic compound in Benghazi, Libya after waves of attacks by militants
      on September 11, 2012. The film stars James Badge Dale, John Krasinski,
      Pablo Schreiber, Max Martini, David Denman and Dominic Fumusa, with
      supporting roles by Toby Stephens, Alexia Barlier and David Costabile.

      grossed $69 million worldwide against a production budget of $50 million,
      becoming one of Bay's lowest-grossing films. It also received mixed
      reviews from critics, who praised its performances, action sequences, and
      dark tone, but criticized the script for historical liberties. Bay's
      direction also received a mixed response, with many criticizing his
      emphasis on over-the-top action, but some also noting it as one of his
      most mature and grounded films. 13 Hours received an Oscar nomination for

      Rhodes, Geoff Stults, Thad Luckinbill, Ben O'Toole, William Fichtner, and

      and lack of hindsight of the War in Afghanistan.[5]
